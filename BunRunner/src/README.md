## Disclaimer
This was my first bigger game (made before I started studying Computer Science), and most of the time I still didn't even know what I was doing. 

## Description
Bun Runner is a game about a bunny that was abandoned in the woods. 
The player navigates three separate areas in order to save the bunny. 
Along the way, the player has to avoid predators and natural hazards.

Bun Runner was inspired by the upcoming Easter holidays of 2015. 
While the Easter bunny is hiding its chocolate eggs, many parents are looking for appropriate gift ideas for their children. 
Sometimes, the choice falls on a pet rabbit, as many believe them to be ‘entry level’ pets. 
Sadly, this is not the case. 
Bunnies are expensive and high-maintenance pets that require lots of attention and care. 
And so, in the aftermath of Easter, more than a few bunnies are abandoned. 
This game aims to bring attention to this issue.

I received excellent feedback for this game and a lot of praise. 
* Stregths were good polish, story/motivation, length/content, and general game play.
* Weaknesses were graphics consistency and difficulty spikes. Turns out only a very small percentage of players made it past level 2 (out of 9 levels).
