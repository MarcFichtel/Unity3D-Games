## Description
This was my first Ludum Dare entry, and also the first time I worked with 3D models in Unity.
The ratings placed us (an artist/modeller, a sound artist, and me for programming) somewhere in the middlefield.

In retrospect, the game turned out ok. 
It's biggest shortcoming, I think, are the clunky physics. 
All things considered (first time in 3D, limited time, working with people I didn't know before) I am happy with what we ended up with.
