# Unity3D-Games
This is where I keep the source code for my personal unity projects

## Projects
* BunRunner
* Codename Catslevania (Ludum Dare Project)
* Black Friday (unpublished)

## Other
* Hith'r & Tith'r: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/658663. I wanted to challenge myself to make a game in 3 days. Unfortunately, I lost the code for it, but wanted to post a link to it anyways. Just as in BunRunner, I had a lot of fun experimenting with the camera in this one.
