# Black Friday
Unpublished.

## Description
An artist who had an idea for a game approached me about collaborating. 

The idea: Black friday sales are coming, and you have to fight your way through hordes of mad consumers to get to the sales you want. It was supposed to be a runner/hack 'n' slash game with an upgrading system between levels, and each level was would end in a boss fight, with 5 levels planned in total.

The concept, I thought, was sound, and the artist's work was decent, so I agreed to do the programming for the game.
Halfway through the development process, the first prototype was looking good, but interest on the artist's side waned over time.
While the game was never completed, the artist approached me again about a year later.
Having taught himself to program, he wanted to finish what we had started. 
Since I was working on different projects now, I handed the code base over to him. That was the last I heard of it.
